# Develop Cmt2

We (human and Claude Code) are working together to complete the Cmt2 dialect. Read (`Status`)[#Status] for basic information. Read and record in (`Tasks`)(#Tasks) for development.

## Status

Base workspace: 
- `/home/uvxiao/circt-cmt2`

For building, cd to `build/` and run `ninja`

The `cmt2` dialect has been added:
- `include/circt/Dialect/Cmt2`
- `lib/Dialect/Cmt2`

Now, only basic operation definitions work. The `circt-opt` (`build/bin/circt-opt`) can parse a `gcd.mlir` (`test/Dialect/Cmt2/gcd.mlir`) example successfully:
```shell
build/bin/circt-opt test/Dialect/Cmt2/gcd.mlir 
```

Docs are maintained at `docs/Dialects/Cmt2/RationaleCmt2.md`

## Tasks

For every task, you should create a TODO list to record the status.

There are empty code blocks in "Spec" sections, which you should fill when conducting the task.

### InstanceGraph Analysis

#### Spec

You should read:
- `include/circt/Support/InstanceGraph.h`
- `include/circt/Support/InstanceGraphInterface.td`
- `include/circt/Support/InstanceGraphInterface.h`
To understand what an InstanceGraph can do. Summarize below:
```text
InstanceGraph Overview:
- A generic instance graph that tracks modules and their instantiation relationships
- Similar to a call graph but for hardware modules
- Core classes:
  1. InstanceRecord: Represents an edge/instantiation in the graph
     - Tracks the instance operation (InstanceOpInterface)
     - Knows its parent module and target module
  2. InstanceGraphNode: Represents a node/module in the graph
     - Tracks the module operation (ModuleOpInterface)
     - Contains list of instances within this module
     - Maintains use list of instances that instantiate this module
     - Provides iterators for both directions
  3. InstanceGraph: The main graph container
     - Built from a parent operation containing modules
     - Maps module names to nodes
     - Supports graph traversal (top-down and bottom-up)
     - Can be used as a cached analysis

Required interfaces (from InstanceGraphInterface.td):
- ModuleOpInterface: Operations that represent modules must implement:
  - getModuleName() and getModuleNameAttr()
- InstanceOpInterface: Operations that represent instances must implement:
  - getInstanceName() and getInstanceNameAttr()
  - getReferencedModuleNames() and getReferencedModuleNamesAttr()
```

We need to add the InstanceGraph support for `cmt2`. 

You should first read:
- `include/circt/Dialect/FIRRTL/FIRRTLInstanceGraph.h`
- `lib/Dialect/FIRRTL/FIRRTLInstanceGraph.cpp`
- `include/circt/Dialect/HW/HWInstanceGraph.h`
- `lib/Dialect/HW/HWInstanceGraph.cpp`
To understand how to add the support. Summarize below:
```text
FIRRTL InstanceGraph Implementation:
- Extends igraph::InstanceGraph base class
- Constructor takes CircuitOp or ModuleOp, finds the CircuitOp inside
- Identifies top-level module from CircuitOp's name attribute
- Very simple: just wraps the generic InstanceGraph with FIRRTL-specific types

HW InstanceGraph Implementation:
- Also extends igraph::InstanceGraph
- Creates a virtual "entry" node that links to all public modules
- Constructor iterates all modules and adds public ones to entry node
- Provides addHWModule() to handle adding new modules
- Overrides erase() to clean up links to the entry node
- More complex: handles the concept of public/private module visibility

Steps to add InstanceGraph support:
1. Ops must implement required interfaces:
   - ModuleOp and ExtModuleHwOp need ModuleOpInterface
   - InstanceOp needs InstanceOpInterface
2. Add these interfaces in the TD file
3. Implement the interface methods in Ops.cpp
4. Create a Cmt2InstanceGraph class (similar to FIRRTL or HW)
5. Decide on top-level module strategy (named like FIRRTL, or virtual entry like HW)
```

You also need to modify:
- `include/circt/Dialect/Cmt2/Cmt2Ops.td`
- `include/circt/Dialect/Cmt2/Cmt2Ops.h`
- `lib/Dialect/Cmt2/Cmt2Ops.cpp`
To give necessary interfaces or methods for Cmt2 operations (`ModuleOp`, `InstanceOp`, and more) according to InstanceGraph's need.

You should add a test pass under `cmt2`. You can look at 
- `include/circt/Dialect/HW/HWPasses.h`
- `include/circt/Dialect/HW/Passes.td`
- `lib/Dialect/HW/Transforms`
to understand how to add a pass.

You should create a test case (similar to `gcd.mlir` but have more module hierarchy), and fill the shell command below to test:
```shell
# Test the InstanceGraph with the hierarchical test case
build/bin/circt-opt test/Dialect/Cmt2/instance-graph.mlir -cmt2-print-instance-graph

# Alternative: Just parse and verify the test case
build/bin/circt-opt test/Dialect/Cmt2/instance-graph.mlir
```
